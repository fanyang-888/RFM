# RFM Customer Segmentation for Lifecycle Marketing

## Executive Summary

This project transforms retail transaction logs into actionable customer segments using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) and clustering diagnostics (KMeans, DBSCAN).  
It is designed as a practical baseline for lifecycle marketing decisions such as retention prioritization, win-back targeting, and high-value cohort management.

## Business Problem

Retail teams often run broad campaigns without clear audience prioritization.  
As a result, high-value and high-risk customers may receive the wrong treatment while spend is wasted on low-impact segments.

## Objective / Hypothesis

**Objective:** Build an interpretable segmentation framework from transaction data that can be used by CRM/Growth teams.  
**Hypothesis:** RFM-based cohorts, supported by unsupervised clustering diagnostics, can reveal distinct customer behavior groups and improve campaign planning quality.

## Dataset

- Source file: `rfm_stock_data.csv`
- Granularity: transaction-level records
- Key fields: `InvoiceNo`, `InvoiceDate`, `Quantity`, `UnitPrice`, `CustomerID`, `Country`
- Domain context: UK online retail transactions

## Methodology

1. **Data preparation**
   - Remove canceled invoices and invalid quantity/price rows
   - Parse timestamp fields and derive `totalcost`
2. **RFM feature engineering**
   - `Recency`: days since last purchase
   - `Frequency`: distinct invoice count per customer
   - `Monetary`: total spend per customer
3. **Segmentation approaches**
   - Rule-based segment labels from normalized R/F/M behavior
   - KMeans clustering with k-range diagnostics
   - DBSCAN clustering as a density-based comparison

## Technical Approach

- Modular pipeline in `src/rfm/`:
  - `data.py`: loading + cleaning
  - `features.py`: RFM feature construction and quartile scoring
  - `labels.py`: rule-based segment mapping
  - `segmentation.py`: KMeans/DBSCAN and cluster diagnostics
- Reproducible runner:
  - `scripts/run_rfm_segmentation.py`
- Notebook artifacts:
  - `rfm_customer_segmentation.ipynb`
  - `how_to_choose_k.ipynb`
  - `kmeans_optimization.ipynb`

## Evaluation Metrics

For KMeans model selection:

- **SSE (Elbow Curve)** for compactness trend
- **Silhouette Score** for cluster separation quality

Current run output (`outputs/kmeans_metrics.csv`) includes `k=2..10` with both metrics.

## Results

From the latest generated metrics:

- Best silhouette score appears at `k=2` (`0.8958`)
- Operational baseline in pipeline uses `k=3` for more granular segmentation
- Output artifacts generated:
  - `outputs/kmeans_metrics.csv`
  - `outputs/kmeans_selection.png`
  - `outputs/rfm_segmentation.csv`

## Business Insights / Recommendations

- Use segment-based treatment strategy instead of one-size-fits-all campaigns.
- Prioritize retention budgets on high-value but declining-frequency cohorts.
- Create separate onboarding and activation flows for low-activity/new cohorts.
- Use clustering diagnostics as a decision aid, not as the only segmentation authority.

## Limitations

- No A/B test or campaign uplift measurement is included yet.
- Segment business impact is not tied to downstream revenue experiments in this repository.
- Data represents one retail context; generalization across industries is not guaranteed.

## Future Improvements

- Add uplift evaluation framework (e.g., retention or conversion lift by segment).
- Compare additional algorithms (e.g., GMM, HDBSCAN) with explicit trade-off criteria.
- Add lightweight tests and data quality checks for production-readiness.
- Package as a simple API or scheduled batch job for deployment simulation.
